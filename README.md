# MM Vacuo Parousia

This is my first official React app. It serves as the website for a Brazilian limited company which supplies scientific equipment for universities and private research.

## Implementation

This code was written entirely with React JS, making much use of its hooks and function components. 

The CSS was written without a template, using almost exclusively class references.
